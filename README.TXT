A school assignment. :-)

Two words are neighbours if they differ by one letter.
Example: {brow, crow} , {brow, row} , {blow, below} are all sets of neighbouring words.
This program calculates the longest chain of neighbours in a list of words.

Example sets:
below blow bow bowl brow crow rot row
be bed bet bud but dig do dog dug get go god got
fat fate fight fit fright gait gate light mite quit quite right sat sigh sight sit site suite writ write
